Summary:
TalkStar is a web application that helps students and professionals improve their presenting skills by analysing
a recording of their speech and providing useful feedback such as content suggestions, filler word counts, an overall
score, and graphs showing how performance has changed over time.

Tools:
- Assembly AI
- Claude
- Python
- React
- Visual Studio Code

Problems:
The ideation phase was especially challenging as we worked to create a service that truly helps people become
rockstars in their own right. Integrating multiple APIs and ensuring smooth data flow between our Python backend and React
frontend demanded iterative problem-solving. Additionally, translating raw quantitative data into actionable, understandable
feedback required careful calibration.
